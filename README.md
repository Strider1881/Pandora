![App Demo](demo.PNG)

A lightweight **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** app built with **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **HuggingFace** (can be used fully **offline and free** for experimental tasks if don't want to use paid openAI credits).  
This project demonstrates how to build a retrieval-based knowledge assistant using your own documents without relying on paid APIs.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Offline / Free** – Uses `sentence-transformers` and `flan-t5-small` locally (no OpenAI key needed)
- 🔍 **Document Search** – Indexes and retrieves contextually relevant information using FAISS
- 💬 **Conversational Interface** – Ask natural language questions about your files
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture** – Swap in OpenAI or HuggingFace models easily
- 🌐 **Streamlit UI** – Simple, interactive web interface
